This folder contains the files relevant to the state-space matrix extraction of the RLC circuit as in the figure RLC_ckt.png as in the OpenModelica schematic RLC_ckt.mo

Output of the compilation of the Modelica file using the command "omc +s +d=bltdump RLC_ckt.mo Modelica > RLC_ckt.txt" generates the output file RLC_ckt.txt

Further, the python script getPolymat.py (as found in the path "../getStateSpace" generates the output files in the folder RLC_ckt_output.
